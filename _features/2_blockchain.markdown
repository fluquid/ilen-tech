One of the first questions people ask is, “what is Blockchain”?

“Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. It fosters a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust, accountability and transparency.”

iLen will design a Blockchain platform which will allow traceability and transparency to all parties engaged in the food production process - 

* Role-based access to food chain data
* End to End traceability from field to fork within a single system
* Allowing the consumer trust in the product’s data rather than the brand
